# Face Blurring App

## Overview
The **Face Blurring App** is a Python-based application built using **Streamlit**, **OpenCV**, and **Mediapipe** for real-time face detection and blurring. Users can upload images or videos, or use their webcam to blur faces in the media. The application detects faces using the **Mediapipe Face Detection model** and applies a blur effect to the face region, preserving privacy in the content.

## Features
- **Real-time face detection** using Mediapipe.
- **Face blurring** on images, videos, or webcam streams.
- **Interactive UI** built using Streamlit for an easy-to-use experience.
- **Supports multiple input sources**: Upload images, upload videos, or use the webcam for live streaming.
- **Efficient face region detection and blurring** using OpenCV.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Main programming language.
- **Streamlit**: For creating the interactive web interface.
- **OpenCV**: For image and video manipulation (applying blur).
- **Mediapipe**: For face detection.
- **NumPy**: For handling image data and arrays.
- **Pillow**: For opening and processing image files.
